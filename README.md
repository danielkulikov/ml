playing around with the MNIST dataset in this repo: implementing various classification algorithms from scratch to classify digits (and practice/improve my coding skills)>
Currently implemented:
  1) 3-layer FFNN
  2) k-NN
  3) Gaussian discriminant analysis (with three variants: QDA, LDA or Gaussian Naive Bayes - this all depends on what form we choose the covariance matrix to take)
  4) k-means
  
To implement:
  5) Linear Regression
  6) Logistic Regression
  7) PCA 
  8) Decision trees
  
Also to add:
jupyter notebook for MNIST -> comparing the classifiers
