# ml
playing around with the MNIST dataset in this repo: implementing various classification algorithms from scratch to classify digits (and practice/improve my coding skills)>
Currently implemented:
  1) 3-layer FFNN
  2) k-NN

To implement:
  3) Naive Bayes
  4) Discriminant Analysis
  5) Linear Regression
  6) Logistic Regression
  7) K-means
  8) PCA 
  9) Decision trees
  
Also to add:
jupyter notebooks for each (or some combined) of the techniques to go through the typical "analytical" process
